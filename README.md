# Credit card generator 

A python script to generate valid demo card numbers.

Currently, the only type of card that can be generated is a visa card.
## Why ?

Sometimes it is good to have an offline tool to generate card numbers meant for testing purposes. 

## How to use

The user needs to add value to the BIN variables. It should be array of 6 entries separated by (,)

```
BIN_1 = []
BIN_2 = []
```

* to run the script use the following command:
```
python3 card_gen.py
```
